# Cosine Demo
A demonstration of Cosine's functionalities can be found at https://cloud-demo-2021.github.io. One can use this demo to interact with Cosine by asking what-if design questions.

# CosineCodeBase README #
There are two separate codebases here - `cosine_models` runs the first phase of Cosine with the cost models and generates the continuum over the massive search space. `hybrid_de` is the templated implementation such that when given inputs it materializes the storage engine.

## Installation
For using these two functionalities, please check out the README of each folder.
